# Who is Aaran Daniel?

Like many people fresh out of university I was unsure which area of business best suited me. When the pandemic struck I was thrust into a varied role that blessed me with the opportunity to explore; I learned about my personal skill set, the things that energised me and those that didn't.

Utilising new technologies and data to solve business problems is something I kept coming back to and wanted to explore more ðŸ“ˆ. 

So, I moved to Argentina for 8 months. The home country of my fiance would provide the basecamp to launch my career in data science. I taught myself Python, SQL, R and Tableau but I wanted to dive deeper. So I went back to school. As a Data Science fellow at General Assembly I delved into Machine Learning and AI, discovering a world I am hugely passionate about. 

On this unpredictable journey of exploration, here are some of the projects I have completed along the way:

- [Disecting Discourse between Stoics and Buddhists - An NLP Project with Python](https://github.com/acdaniel864/nlp-reddit-classification)
- [Application and Model for Valuing Consumer Wine](https://github.com/acdaniel864/capstone)
- [Credit Growth & Delinquency Forecasting and Consultancy - A Time Series Project with Python](https://github.com/acdaniel864/time-series-credit-forecasting)
- [Buenos Aires Short-Let Market Analysis - A Data Analytics Project with SQL, R & Tableau](https://medium.com/@aarandaniel/airbnbs-in-buenos-aires-f40274f219fb)


I am energised by fixing things, taking on big projects and solving problems. I enjoy working for a cause that I feel has the power to benefit people in a sustainable way: to live healthier, happier and more empowered lives. In my free time I like to write songs, watch/play sports, argue about politics, sing, dance badly, laugh and travel.
