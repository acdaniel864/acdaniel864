# Who is Aaran Daniel?

Like many people fresh out of university I was unsure which area of business best suited me. When the pandemic struck I was thrust into a varied role that blessed me with the opportunity to explore; I learned about my personal skill set, the things that energised me and those that didn't.

Utilising new technologies and data to solve business problems is something I kept coming back to ðŸ“ˆ. So I saved up some money and moved to Argentina for 8 months. I taught myself Python, SQL, R and Tableau, I also picked up some Spanish along the way but I wanted to dive deeper into Data Science. So I went back to school, as a Data Science fellow with General Assembly I dove deep into Machine Learning and AI disocvering a world I am hugely passionate about. 

On this continous and unpredictable journey of exploration that we call life, here are some of the projects I have completed along the way:

- Project 1
- Project 2
- (Buenos Aires Short-Let Market Analysis with SQL, R & Tableau)[https://medium.com/@aarandaniel/airbnbs-in-buenos-aires-f40274f219fb]
- Project 4
- Project 5

I am energised by fixing things, taking on big projects and solving problems with data. I enjoy working for a cause that I feel has the power to benefit people in a sustainable way: to live healthier, happier and more empowered lives.
