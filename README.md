# Who is Aaran Daniel?

Like many people fresh out of university I was unsure which area of business best suited me. When the pandemic struck I was thrust into a varied role that blessed me with the opportunity to explore; I learned about my personal skill set, the things that energised me and those that didn't.

Utilising new technologies and data to solve business problems is something I kept coming back to ðŸ“ˆ. So I saved up some money and moved to Argentina for 8 months. I taught myself Python, SQL, R and Tableau but I wanted to dive deeper into Data Science. So I went back to school. As a Data Science fellow with General Assembly I dove deep into Machine Learning and AI disocvering a world I am hugely passionate about. 

On this continous and unpredictable journey of exploration that we call life, here are some of the projects I have completed along the way:

- [Disecting Discourse between Stoics and Buddhists - An NLP Project - Python](https://github.com/acdaniel864/nlp-reddit-classification)
- [Debt/Credit Forecasting and Consultancy - A Time Series Project - Python](https://github.com/acdaniel864/time-series-credit-forecasting)
- [Buenos Aires Short-Let Market Analysis - A Data Analytics Project - SQL, R & Tableau](https://medium.com/@aarandaniel/airbnbs-in-buenos-aires-f40274f219fb)
- [An Application and Model for Bargain Wines - work-in-progress](https://github.com/acdaniel864/capstone)

I am energised by fixing things, taking on big projects and solving problems with data. I enjoy working for a cause that I feel has the power to benefit people in a sustainable way: to live healthier, happier and more empowered lives. In my free time I like to write songs, watch/play sports, argue about politics, sing, dance badly, laugh and travel.
